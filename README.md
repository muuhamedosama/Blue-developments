# Blue-developments
I worked based on microservices architecture.

to run frontend:
  npm i
  npm run dev

for the auth-service and task-service:
  npm i 
  npm start

.env file for auth service:
  DB_USER=mohamedosa
  DB_PASSWORD=qwerty00
  DB_NAME=usersDB
  TOKEN_KEY=supersecret
  PORT=5000

.env file for auth service:
  DB_USER=mohamedosa
  DB_PASSWORD=qwerty00
  DB_NAME=tasksDB
  TOKEN_KEY=supersecret
  PORT=5001

let me know if you need me to connect you to my mongoDB cluster :D,
Thank you for this opportunity.
